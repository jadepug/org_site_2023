description: "Backwords is a novel and fun game that challenges players to speak backwards.<br><br>
After recording a short vocal clue, users listen to the clue in reverse and try to mimic the sound.
Next, listen to both the clue and answer recordings side by side to see how close you got!
Backwords can be played solo, or with friends. Try recreating an audio clue recorded by someone else!"
